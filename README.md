I'm a researcher and a PhD student in Language Technology at 
[University of Helsinki](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/). 
My research focuses on computational semantics, natural language understanding, machine translation and machine learning. 

- üî¨ I'm currently working on my PhD on Natural Language Inference. 

- ‚òÅÔ∏è I also work as the CTO at [Nordcloud](https://www.nordcloud.com) UK. Nordcloud is a leading European public cloud managed and 
professional service provider.

### Some of my work

1.  **[Prosody](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/prosody)**: Contains code and data. A system for predicting prosodic prominence from written text. The prosody corpus contains automatically generated, high quality prosodic annotations for the LibriTTS corpus (Zen et al. 2019) using the Continuous Wavelet Transform Annotation method (Suni et al. 2017).
