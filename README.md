### Hi!


- ðŸ¤– I a Senior AI Engineer at [Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai). Silo AI is the largest private AI lab in the Nordics.

- ðŸ”¬ I'm also a researcher and a PhD student in Language Technology at 
[University of Helsinki](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/). 
My research focuses on natural language processing, natural language understanding, machine translation and machine learning. I'm currently working on my PhD on Natural Language Inference.

### Some of my academic work

* **[NLI Data Sanity Check](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/nli-data-sanity-check):**
This repository contains data and a sample script for the paper:
Aarne Talman, Marianna Apidianaki, Stergios Chatzikyriakidis, JÃ¶rg Tiedemann. 2021 (forthcoming). NLI Data Sanity Check: Assessing the Effect of Data Corruption on Model Performance. Proceedings of NoDaLiDa.

* **[Prosody](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/prosody):**
Contains the largest annotated dataset of English language with labels for prosodic prominence. Also contains code for predicting 
prosodic prominence from written text using different models, like BERT and BiLSTM. The prosody corpus contains automatically generated, high quality prosodic annotations for the LibriTTS corpus (Zen et al. 2019) using the Continuous Wavelet Transform Annotation method (Suni et al. 2017). [[paper](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W19-6129/)]

* **[Natural Language Inference system (HBMP)](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/HBMP):**
Natural language inference system written in Python and PyTorch implementing the HBMP sentence encoder. [[paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/sentence-embeddings-in-nli-with-iterative-refinement-encoders/AC811644D52446E414333B20FEACE00F)]

* **[NLP Notebooks](https://github.com/aarnetalman/Notebooks):** Jupyter notebooks exploring different NLP/ML use cases and tasks. Some of the
notebooks have been published as blog posts on my website [https://talman.io](https://talman.io).

* **[NLI with Transformers](https://github.com/aarnetalman/nli-with-transformers):** Code for fine-tuning different transformers models with NLI data.
