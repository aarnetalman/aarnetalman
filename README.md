I'm a researcher and a PhD student in Language Technology at 
[University of Helsinki](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/). 
My research focuses on computational semantics, natural language understanding, machine translation and machine learning. 

- 🔬 I'm currently working on my PhD on Natural Language Inference (NLI, sometimes also known as Textual Entailment). 

- ☁️ I also work as the CTO at [Nordcloud](https://www.nordcloud.com) UK. Nordcloud is a leading European public cloud managed and 
professional service provider.
