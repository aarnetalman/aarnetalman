I'm a researcher and a PhD student in Language Technology at 
[University of Helsinki](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/). 
My research focuses on computational semantics, natural language understanding, machine translation and machine learning. 
I'm currently working on my PhD on Natural Language Inference (NLI, sometimes also known as Textual Entailment). 
NLI is the task of modeling the semantic relationship between two or more sentences.

I also work as the CTO at [Nordcloud](https://www.nordcloud.com) UK. Nordcloud is a leading European public cloud managed and 
professional service provider.

I have 15 years of experience in software development, architecture, management consulting, startup business, 
AI/ML and NLP development and academic research.
