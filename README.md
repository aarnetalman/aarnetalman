### Hi!

I'm a researcher and a PhD student in Language Technology at 
[University of Helsinki](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/). 
My research focuses on computational semantics, natural language understanding, machine translation and machine learning. 

- üî¨ I'm currently working on my PhD on Natural Language Inference. 

- ‚òÅÔ∏è I also work as the CTO at [Nordcloud](https://www.nordcloud.com) UK. Nordcloud is a leading European public cloud managed and 
professional service provider.

Visit my [website](https://talman.io) for moire details.

### Some of my work

* **[Prosody](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/prosody):**
Contains the largest annotated dataset of English language, with labels for prosodic prominence, and the code for predicting 
prosodic prominence from written text using different models, like BERT and BiLSTM. The prosody corpus contains automatically generated, high quality prosodic annotations for the LibriTTS corpus (Zen et al. 2019) using the Continuous Wavelet Transform Annotation method (Suni et al. 2017). [[paper](https://aclweb.org/anthology/W19-6129/)]

* **[Natural Language Inference system (HBMP)](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/HBMP):**
Natural language inference system written in Python and PyTorch implementing the HBMP sentence encoder. [[paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering/article/sentence-embeddings-in-nli-with-iterative-refinement-encoders/AC811644D52446E414333B20FEACE00F)]

* **[NLP Notebooks](https://github.com/aarnetalman/Notebooks):** Jupyter notebooks exploring different NLP/ML use cases and tasks. Some of the
notebooks have been published as blog posts on my website [https://talman.io](https://talman.io).

* **[NLI with Transformers](https://github.com/aarnetalman/nli-with-transformers):** Code for fine-tuning different transformers models with NLI data.
